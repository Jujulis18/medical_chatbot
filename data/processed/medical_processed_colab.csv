medical_133600,Are cerebral palsy and periventricular leukomalacia related ?,"We are now raising my nephew who is diagnosed with Cerebal Palsey. His medical history is as follows.

At his 6 month check-up they decided to do a EEG and an MRI because sometimes (more so when laying down) his eyes would roll downward for a split second then right back up, the results for the EEG were normal, but the MRI showed a subdural benign extra-axial fluid of infantcy.

But in lipid profile, the cholesterol levels are high, and HDL levels are low (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Deranged lipid profile is one of the common reasons for reduced libido and sexual dysfunction. You should try to improve your physical activities and try to bring weight and lipids in a normal range. Exercise will help in improving the libido too. For weak erection and reduced libido drugs like PDE-5 (Phosphodiesterase) inhibitors like Tadalafil can be used. Low dose Tadalafil in 5 mg per day after dinner daily will help to make a strong erection. To improve erection at the time of sexual intercourse, you can take an extra 10 mg tablet on SOS basis about half to one hour before sex. Kindly consult your doctor for suggestions and take the treatment with consent. This will improve libido and will make erection hard. Avoid smoking, and alcohol use to stay healthy. Supplements containing L-arginine and Yohimbine have great roles in improving libido.

If your attending doctor shows no concern toward your problem, please take a second opinion. The viability of the pregnancy should be established through a trans-vaginal sonogram. If there is any hemorrhage seen, the need to initiate hormone supplements must be thought of. Absolute bed rest, avoidance of all strenuous activity including sexual intercourse are mandatory. If needed, serial titres of serum beta-hCG may be taken since good progress of the pregnancy is seen when there are doubling titres every 2-3 days.

An X-ray is definitely necessary to check whether there is any damage to the following permanent tooth within the bone. Secondly, if there is pulp exposure alone, we can do pulpectomy (like RCT) and if just enamel or dentin fracture, we can either smoothen the margins or fill it with tooth-colored cement.

medical_178832,Suggest remedy and precautions for hepatitis b,"Hello Sir,I donated blood on 26 January, they told me i have Hepatitis B. On doctor's advise I have gone thorough multiple blood tests also one ultrasonic test. All reports were negative except for Hepatitis B surface antigen. All those test were done in March 2011, in August again I gone for Hepatitis B surface antigen test and report says ""Reactive"". Do I need to take some precautions, medications etc. I am perfectly normal, I mean i don't have any symptoms. What should I do now. I am Pune so it will be great for me if you can suggest me a doctor in Pune.","Hello and welcome to HCM!To summarize it briefly: you are amongst those persons who, when contacting hepatitis B virus, cannot get rid of it. Almost 10-15% of all persons contacting hepatitis B virus can not eradicate it and become the so-called ""a Hepatitis B carrier"". There are two types of hepatitis B chronic carriers: active carrier and passive carrier. An active carrier is a person infected with hepatitis B and that shows signs and symptoms of the disease.  A passive carrier is a person who has the disease in its body but it doesn't manifest any signs and/or symptoms. Since you report that you did several test back in 2011, and you are feeling perfectly healthy, then I guess that you are a passive carrier of hepatitis B and probably you will continue to have this status for the rest of your life if you do not engage in excessive unhealthy behaviors such excessive alcohol intake, etc. Unfortunately, there is no ultimate cure for chronic B hepatitis. You can try with interferon therapy, but this is expensive and in a good proportion of cases it can only achieve a lowering of the titer of HBsAg surface antigen without eradicating it. On the other hand, treatment of hepatitis B with interferon or other anti-viral drugs is advised only if there are signs of liver damage but this is not your case. Vaccinating against hepatitis B at this stage is of little benefit as well, even though it is not harmful.However, please not that you can pass the infection to other people through unprotected sexual intercourse or if your blood comes in contact to that of other people. Therefore, you can not donate blood anymore. Therefore, my advice would be: do not engage in unhealthy behaviors such as excessive alcohol intake, in order to not ""wake-up"" the silent disease. If you are careful then you can live a perfectly healthy life. Lastly, carriers of hepatitis B need to measure the levels of liver enzymes such as ALT and AST periodically in order to monitor its function.I hope I have answered your concern!

Because some says that alcohol can interfere the pill.

If you vomit within two hours of taking your pill, you may not absorb the pill, which could increase your risk of ovulating.So if you have vomiting after 2 hour of taking pill then use barrier contraception for next week.But I think you have not any vomiting, sickness and missing pill, so no chance of the pregnancy.Hope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr. Sagar",endocrinology,low,[],[],1.0,1.0,1285,False

This is not a disease.Occasional failure can occur to almost every man in his life. When this happens, one gets concerned about performance during next sexual encounter. He thinks whether he would be able to satisfy the partner or not. So, his mind thinks mostly about quality of erection and performance.For constant erection continuous exciting/romantic/erotic feelings should be there in mind. If mind is diverted to concern about erection (being tensed in your case), you will lose erection.This in turn reduces your confidence and it again affects the erection.Having erection during masturbation indicates that your organs are functioning absolutely normally.There are effective behavior therapies having strong research evidence for psychogenic erectile dysfunction.

The causes of this rhythm issue also might be different like simple emotional stress,  coffee or alcohol consumption or pathologys like anemia , hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances , active infections,  heart disease ect.So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram , a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls,  a full blood analyze to exclude anemia,  hyperthyroidism or electrolyte imbalance and of course a holter pressure and rhythm monitoring to evaluate your rhythm tendency and your pressure values. Of course you have to continue  your blood pressure medication and sinus infection becouse it might be the cause of your symtoms. I will advise you to go to the emergency room only if you have episodes whith chaotic and very fast beats because in this case it might an arythmia that needs medical attention.

I have two fibroids 9 cm total size and was advised to take 2 x 500 mg three times a day but it completely stops the bleeding but the bleeding starts after three days again. I have had on and off bleeding for two weeks now. Is this a common problem with the medication? I am extremely worried and cannot be normal. Please help and advise.","Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It would have been helpful if you could attach the report of your ultrasound for me to have a look. Based on what you mentioned about the total size of two fibroids to be ~9 cm, I am assuming each one must be less than 5 cm and not so huge. Fibroids would not cause irregular bleeding unless they are lying close to the uterine cavity. Usually, in the perimenopausal age group of women, like you are already 48, we prefer to give medical management so as to control the bleeding in those who have excess bleeding. As with age, your menopause may set in and menses will eventually stop and then you will not have any problems because of the fibroids. This is done to avoid unnecessary surgery when the bleeding would anyways stop after menopause. In your case, I would like to know if the fibroids are close to the uterine cavity on ultrasound which may cause irregular bleeding. Also, in your query, the drug name has not come, but I guess it is Tranexamic acid (or Trapic or Pause) which just controls the excessive bleeding means will reduce the bleeding. But will neither stop the bleeding pattern due to hormonal disturbance in the perimenopausal abnormal bleeding nor due to the fibroids which bleed due to the close situation to the uterine cavity. Other causes if irregular bleeding apart from fibroids need to be evaluated like hormonal changes, thyroid issues, or uterine lining (endometrial) thickening, etc. If it is due to fibroid position that is causing off and on bleeding, it may not stop with Trapic (but only will reduce in amount) and may stop only after menopause or after the surgical removal of the uterus. But if it is due to the hormonal disturbance or due to the perimenopausal phase, it needs to be controlled with some hormonal medications. It would be good if you could connect with me through chat and share the reports of yours so that we can have a close look if any further evaluation needs to be done regarding the abnormal bleeding pattern.

It s like making contraction and going up and I feel pain, but usually don t feel that much pain. Thanks. I really apriciate your answer and your time.","DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. You must be aware that masturbation is no sin. Masturbation is natural and even animals do it. For an youngster of age group 13 to 17 masturbation everyday is normal. After that also it is normal but people get engaged in some other activities like games, education, career etc which are more engaging and energy consuming. There are people who masturbate daily even at middle adulthood. The trouble is lack of knowledge and the anxiety arising out of it. Feeling guilty will trigger anxiety. Masturbation is not unhealthy and cannot be a cause to hernia.Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The causes may be many like. ...tension,anxiety, thyroid diseases, endocrinal diseases, hormonal diseases, diseases like typhoid, malaria,viral diseases,surgery,trauma,drugs like anticancer ..methotraxate ,internal diseases,anaemia,nutritional deficiencies..... etc might precipitate the disease. Excessive sun exposure may be resposible for the disease. Dandruff may be responsible..it should be ruled out. If it is there, ketoconazole shampoo may be done.Androgenetic alopecia may be featured with reccession of hairline backward from frontal scalp. The hairs become thin and sparse. There may be hair loss from occipital area also.You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis.Investigations may be done to rule out thyroid disease and other internal diseases. If they are there,proper treatment may be taken.-Nutritional deficiencies may be treated.-Tab Biotin 10 mg daily may be taken for long time.-Vitamin E cap 400 mg daily may be taken.-Minerals like iron, calcium, zinc..etc may be taken in proper dose.-Application of minoxidil 10% twice a day and to take finesteride 1 mg daily..if you have androgenetic alopecia or-Mild steroid lotion may be applied on the scalp daily at night if you have telogen effluvium.-Mild herbal shampoo may be done twice a week.Be confident for the good result..

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

medical_14607,Q. Are high sugar and raised liver enzymes side effects of Protonix?,"Hi doctor, I have been taking Protonix for almost three weeks for acid reflux. I had some blood laboratory work done and it showed my AST 812 and ALT 1,115. Could this be a rare side effect of Protonix? My glucose also went up to 192 and lipase is 72. I do not drink, smoke or use drugs. My doctor ran more tests the next day, but has not gotten the results yet. So, he has not prescribed anything yet for my sugar levels. She knows that I have not been feeling well for the past three weeks. I just stopped taking Protonix from yesterday. Also, I discontinued my regular Plaquenil before three months, which I used to have for the past 20 years for fatty tumors in my arm. Is there anything I can take to bring both the liver function and sugar down?","Hello. Is this the only liver function test you have? I wanted to trend it. Plaquenil (Hydroxychloroquine) and Protonix (Pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test, but it is relatively rare with Protonix. I also want to make sure that you are not using Aspirin, Tylenol or cholesterol medications, since they can have direct effects on the liver. Another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis, which again could be a rare side effect of Protonix. But, this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. A person, who has prediabetes, may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. I was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. For high blood sugars, I would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet, soda, bakery products, white bread or pasta and juices. Hydrate yourself with plenty of water.

I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The valve replacement surgery is usually done using open heart surgery technique, and the surgeon connects the blood vessels to a heart-lung machine and then stops the heart. After this step, an incision is made into the aorta and using careful precision the aortic valve will get replaced. This operation is 98 percent successful. For people less than 65 years, the valve implanted is a mechanical valve, and this is because a mechanical valve will work for many years. In patients older than 65 years, a biological valve is used. He can lead a near normal healthy life. He has to follow up with his doctor regularly and be on medications for a long time. He will be in the hospital for a week and should not be on bed rest. Only thing is he must avoid physical exertion after surgery and take strict precautions for three months after surgery.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I have seen my GP who had referred me to a cardiologist, neurologist and ENT. My Dr first referred me to a cardiologist after she couldn t find the cause for my dizziness to have a 24hr holter monitor the results came back as a First Degree AV Block but no further action was taken regarding this. They later done an ECO, Stress ECO, Brain MRI, Brain CT and they all came back clear. My cardiologist wasn t satisfied so he referred me to another Cardiologist interstate in Queensland for a Transcranial Doppler. My results where positive Grade 5 so 2 weeks later they attempted a PFO Closure which was unsuccessful, they could not locate the hole. After surgery they told me it was the first time this had happened to them and they were unsure of why they couldn t find the hole or a reason for the test to be positive at a Grade 5 level and he told me to see a ENT. The ENT i seen done a hearing test, allergy test and another test where they squirt water in your ear. All results come back normal except they discovered a dust might allergy. They later done food allergies and blood tests to check for other virus the results came back with no food allergies but a positive to Epstein Barr Virus. The ENT told me and made me believe it was a rare viral infection from the middle east that could be fixed with vitamins and B12 injections. I went home done some research and discovered over 95% of the population has it, i went and seen my GP the next day to discuss my results which she had sent to her to discover i do not have a current infection and the ENT had lied.

medical_6711,Q. Why are there inflamed nasal swellings and ear plugs?,"Hello doctor, I apologize for the long message, but I am a concerned mom. I have two sons (ages 3 and 5) and both of them and I have been experiencing chronic sinus or ear issues for the past several months. Their pediatrician has referred us to ENT since she does not know what it is. Both boys (and myself) have inflamed nasal swellings that block the nasal passages. We all have deviated septums. My 3-year-old has dog and cat allergy and is prescribed Nasocort and Zyrtec daily which are ineffective. The 5-year-old tested negative for all allergies. We use top line air purifiers throughout the house but are still experiencing severe symptoms. The boys had tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies tubes last year due to scale 4 with obstructive tonsils or adenoids. Nightly I have extracted sticky, firm clumps from behind the nasal swellings that only appear after massaging sinuses. They do not drain out on their own. Both boys ears are totally blocked. And my 5-year-old had dark brown fluid with strong foul odor leak out of one ear the other night. Both have recently been on Azithromycin (3 day doses of 5 ml per day) but symptoms have not improved. Not sure if any of the following are related, but all occured around the time symptoms began. My dad was at our house with a severe bronchial and sinus related illness and and also diagnosed with candida. We had also just been swimming in a lake. We live directly across from a large scale construction project that produces lots of dust that began around same time. My youngest had a recent staphylococcal infection on his arm treated topically with muciprocin. Any clues about what this could be and if it requires more immediate action vs. wait for ENT appointment?","Hi. Do not stop Zyrtec (Cetirizine) and nasal corticosteroid spray. The polluted environment around you can harm your children badly. I think that the black plug inside your son's ear is a fungal infection. You need a topical antifungal drop for five days, then the ENT specialist will wash it off, vacuum it. There is a great possibility that all of you have caught an infection from the old grandfather. I recommend immunotherapy for your children if the medical treatment does not help.

The pain usually radiates to the groin or even a leg. Such strong pain appears because a stone moves through the ureter and irritate it. Sometimes it can stuck.

During ovulation, the cervical mucus increases in volume and becomes thicker due to increased estrogen levels. It is often said that the cervical mucus resembles egg whites at a woman's most fertile point.2.Ovulation may also lead to a 0.4 to 1.0 degree increase in basal body temperature, but difficult to determine this rise3.Finally, ovulation predictor kits are available from drug stores (like i sure) that are able to detect the increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine just before ovulation.Most of the women who have regular cycles ovulate, but if you think that you are going through cycles without ovulation then its better to consult a gynecologist and she/he may suggest you a scan.A women said to be Infertile if she fails to become pregnant after 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse, I suggest you to eat nutritious diet, Take Tab ovacare 0-1-0 for 3 months (it contains nutriernts which helps in ovulation) and observe for 3 months, if you fail to conceive its time to consult an expert.

At the time of ECG, my blood pressure was 168/100 and heart beat 46.","Hello. I have gone through your ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The reports mentioned on ECG are machine generated and are frequently inaccurate. There is no clear-cut evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG. As you also do not have any history of chest pain, it is unlikely for you to have any heart attack. And yes, heart rate is low and it is sinus bradycardia. Do you have any symptoms of dizziness, syncope, etc? If not then it needs no action at the moment. However, you should undergo thyroid test to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause for low heart rate. Also, should undergo echo, which will additionally provide the assurance to rule out MI. Also, if echo is normal then should have TMT (treadmill test), which will help in ruling out minor blockages, subclinical ischemic heart disease and to look for maximum heart rate you achieve during exercise, which will help in determining the benign nature of sinus bradycardia if the adequate heart rate is achieved. Also, high bp can also cause low heart rate by a reflex mechanism. So you should have medicine for it. I guess you are not receiving any medicines like beta blockers which can reduce heart rate. You should have tablet Telma CTD (Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone) 40/12.5 mg once a day in the morning for hypertension so get it prescribed by a local doctor.

Done root canal,"I have seen my family doctor for audio hallucinations that occur only when my mother s boyfriend around, I live with them. I usually hear them talking about me at night or hear him speaking poorly of me when I am in the other room, and in reality he is very passive/aggressive so I consider the possibility of it being true, however every time I ask my mother swears I am hearing things and they never speak of me. I have been on Zoloft since I was 18, I am now 30. My father had me put on it because I was fighting with a friend and sad, now I have been on it for years. I used Vicodin and other opiates, never heroin though, for roughly 10 years off and on, and only became a daily user toward the end which resulted in a rehab stay for 90 days the beginning of 2010. I also used meth for 10 days between rehab stays, a mishap with another client there. The first stay was 44 days and the second I made the entire 90. A slight relapse that lasted 20 days last august with Roxycontin 40 s and I have been clean and sober ever since. They put me on Topamax 50 mg, 1 25mg in the morning and one in the evening when I was in rehab. When I visited my doctor out here in Vegas, I was in rehab and put on Topamax in CA, she changed me from 2-25 mgs to one 50 mg a night. Three weeks later I hear voices. I am curious however if it could be due to the fact that I had a root canal I never got to finish having closed. They drilled the hole and took out the root, put in a small filling, but that recently fell out and I had and still have no health insurance to get a bridge. So what do you think doc?",Your auditory hallucination needs proper assessment by a Psychiatrist.

The normal creatinine level in blood is less than 1.3 in most clinics. If your creatinine level in blood is 1.84 then it is increased. This can mean that the kidney filtration rate has decreased with time. A nephrologist is the specialist in kidney disease and they will evaualte kidney function in detail and suggest investigations like urinary protein, creatinine clearance and if required then a nuclear scan based on your clinical symptoms and medical history.Occasionally food habits can cause increase in blood creatinine level and this is to be discussed. Research shows an increase in serum creatinine can result from increased ingestion of cooked meat (which contains creatinine converted from creatine by the heat from cooking) or increased intake of protein and creatine supplements, in excess of the recommended dosage and therefore requires you to talk to your doctor.

medical_242146,Suggest remedy for dark undereyes,"Hi, I'm 13 and have a pale complexion, my under eyes are very dark and sunken in! My dermatologist told me it is like that because my skin there is very thin, which results in the appearance of my blood vessels to show. I have tried concealer, frozen spoons you name it... Is there any creams out there that could help my problem? I'm just starting out teen years so surgery really isn't an option for me right now, being I'm so young. But the appearance of the sunken in eyes are obvious. They make me look so tired! Any help; tips will be very much appreciated.","Hello and welcome to healthcaremagic.I have gone through your concern and i have understood it.Dark circles can be quite difficult to treat. Hereditary seems to play a significant role. In allergy prone individuals, a condition or state of 'atopy' exists & these atopic individuals more often than not manifest with 'dark circles' under the eyes.It also depends a lot on your lifestyle pattern- diet, sleep, computer / TV use and stress. Stressors/ Strain due to working for long hours on computers & lack of sleep play a major role tooThin under eye skin is also a factor in causing dark circles, the thin skin makes the blood vessels under the skin very prominent and hence this appears dark. You could benefit from using a cream containing Vitamin K and Retinol( EGA cream). Use it once a day for at least 3 months to notice a difference.Another important cause of undereye dark circles is Iron deficiency Anemia. As can be judged from some of the reasons cited, good hydration, regular 6-8 hours of sleep, addressing stressors and a multivitamin and Iron supplement by themselves will go a long way in correcting this issue.Skin lightening cream containing glycolic acid, kojic acid, Vit C can be helpful in reducing the appearance of dark circles.Glycolic acid and Arginine peels are the two commonly used peels by dermatologists for undereye dark circles. You can try a few peeling sessions (6-8 sessions)Regards",dermatology,low,['tried concealer'],['anemia'],1.0,1.0,1981,False

It is unfortunate he developed but it does not mean it is the end for him. As long as he takes his medications, does his routine laboratory workups and checks with his physician then there is nothing much to worry about. He must be informed that as long as he consults with his physician regularly then there will always be an expert making sure he is doing alright and making sure that no complications will develop because of the disease. If the pandemic is causing more worries, it is normal. He might be aware that his condition puts him at a disadvantage compared to a normal healthy individual. But as long as he adheres to social distancing, proper handwashing techniques, precautionary measures such as wearing masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment), if needed, then there is a low risk he might acquire the disease. Remember, diabetes and COVID-19 both are preventable diseases. He needs to take care of himself properly and to do this is by following his doctor's orders and guidelines during the pandemic. However, I am worried about the declared respiratory rate of 86 (normal is at 18-22). Does he smoke? Any cough or colds? Previous hospitalizations?

Recently, I consulted a psychiatrist for a health issue and the doctor prescribed tablet Flunil 20, an antidepressant. After about two to three weeks, I noticed that I was becoming more and more asexual. My sexual desire and interest started to diminish. I can masturbate but it is not pleasurable and I end up extremely dissatisfied and tired at the end. My overall sexual desire has gone down and sexual feelings are kind of lost. Are these the side effects of the antidepressant drug? Should I stop taking this drug?","Hi. Fluoxetine (Flunil 20) belongs to the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of antidepressants. Fluoxetine is one of the notorious antidepressants in relation to sexual side effects. The available data indicate that about 30 to 40 % of those taking Fluoxetine develop some sexual side effects. In regard to the reversal of side effects, it is said that once you stop the drug, the side effects recover almost completely. There is no need to worry if you are recovering from the ailment for which Flunil was prescribed. But, if you do not see any improvement even after four weeks of treatment, then it is advisable to stop Flunil and use a better alternative.",general,low,[],[],1.0,1.0,1235,False

In the last ultrasound the gyno has told that my wifes right egg is fully matured and is ready to ovulate . Can you pls let me know the best time to mate . We have last made love 3 days ago . thanks .,"Hello and welcome,I am Dr Nilajkumar a consultant gynecologist and I will be helping you in your queries. I understand that you have come back for a very short time. Unfortunately the mature egg report remains valid only for a day or two as the egg releases after this and if sexual contact occurs during that time pregnancy is possible. So please check if you had contact during the time the egg was likely to be released [ next 1-2 days after the scan].I will inform you a little about the female physiology and how pregnancy occurs. Every month a single female egg is produced and released to be fertilised by the male sperm. This occurs on day 14 of the cycle in women with regular cycles but may occur on any day from day 12-18. The egg is alive for only 24-36 hours and after that it is lost. So contact during this narrow time of egg release will result in pregnancy. Rest of the whole month sexual contact will not cause pregnancy. Normally couples have contact 2-3 times a week and in one of the month it happens during ovulation resulting in pregnancy. The day of ovulation can be judged by thinning of cervical mucus, increase in basal body temperature measured by a special thermometer before getting up from bed daily or using ovulation detecting kits. I hope that you understand it now and will be able to plan things accordingly.

When this happens, the more I think about it the more I notice it. It feels as if my heart skips a beat. I normally don't notice it during the day. I also sometimes have a pain in the left side of my neck, not severe just a dull ache, that can sometimes be relieved by moving my head. I do notice this more when I've had a stressful day or when I'm worried about something. Should I be concerned?","Hello and thank you for using HCM.I carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern. But you should not worry.These skipped beats have to do with some electrical issues in the heart. Some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinusal rhythm cause a premature heart contraction that you feel like a skipped beat, because its not a normal one. This extra-sistolik beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. If this are not frequent, in Young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about.There are different factors that might cause this skipped beats like emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption , coca-cola or energy drinks, so you have to avoid them.Pathology like anemia or hyperthyroidism might be other causes. The pain in the neck, relived with changing position is not related whith the palpitations. It might be related to muscular or cervical problems.So, if I was your treating doctor i would say that you have nothing to worry for the palpitations if this happen once a wile, its normal. As you say, they might just be related to stress. But if they begin to bother you and interfere in your live we can decide to do some examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echo-cardiography and of course a holter rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm and the extra-sistolik beat frequencies.

Then gradually add them to your diet again, one by one, while keeping track of your symptoms. This should let you determine which foods trigger flatulence for you. Then you can avoid them. •If you need to add more fiber to your diet, increase your fiber slowly over a period of days or weeks. A sudden increase in dietary fiber often triggers flatulence, but a gradual increase may not. •If you eat beans, try a nonprescription product, such as Beano, containing enzymes that break up the poorly digested sugars found in beans.

Firstly I want to tell you that there many reasons or factors which are responsible for not getting pregnancy. These factors can be present in wife or in husband or in both.In most few cases reasons are unknown.in case of female most common reason is ovarian factors like- irregular menses, cystic ovaries etc.tubal factors like blockage of one or both fallopian tubes, uterine factors like fibroid etc. Sometimes there is a hormonal causes like abnormal thyroid hormones, excessive secretion of prolactin hormone etc In case of male most common factor is abnormality in sperm or sperm production etc.Secondly let us discuss about your problem:- as you told that I missed your period for 2 month but pregnancy test was negative and you are having pain, white spot around nipple and on squeezing there is discharge from nipple,right.This problems mostly occurs in case of high prolactin level in the body. It is milk producing hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland. When it's level is high in body, it causes irregular menses and milky discharge from the nipple etc. But you have not given information regarding your menses whether it is regular earlier or irregular from the starting and also you have not told about the character of the nipple discharge. So it is difficult for me to comment on this. With above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. As you told that you are taking birth control pills. This pills are given for regularization of menses. Once your menses will regular, there is high chances of getting pregnant. So DON'T WORRY.2. Try to do coitus in fertile period (it starts from 10th-16th day of menses) during this period chances of getting pregnant is high). So do coitus as more as possible.3.

Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines. Common possibilities in his age are: 1. Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs. This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension. The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others. 2. The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel. 3. And lastly, since he has a problem with constipation the gas accumulation can also be the reason of his abdominal pain. But remember, we cannot say that it is because of gas distension unless we exclude all other possibilities which are more concerning. I suggest you to get investigations which I write below. Only after the investigation, we can be able to diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. I really hope this set of investigations will help us to approach the problem correctly. Mesenteric ischemia. Pancreatitis, gall bladder or common bile duct stones. Colitis, colonic neoplasia. Gas, constipation related. Compete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. Serum lactate level and serum CRP (c-reactive protein). HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin). Lipid profile. Stool for detailed report. Stool for occult blood on consecutive three days. Stool for fecal calprotectin. Capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals. Ispagol husk two tablespoons full with water daily.

Meanwhile, you should: -take an anti-inflammatory drug, Naproxen once daily, for pain relief. -exercise more -try to lose weight, and eat a healthy diet -and take hyaluronic acid supplements.

But since the jaundice in your case has been successfully treated by the stent and surgery, there is no need for you stick to any kind of diet, although in general avoiding excess fatty food is good for your general health. It does not matter if you are a vegetarian. The diet sheet is just a suggestion and not a rule.

Thanks and regards, Habib","Hello Habib,Asthma is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages.Management consists of:1. Oxygen inhalation, broncho-dilators and corticosteroids - provide symptomatic relief during acute attack by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy.3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Protection from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.Though prolonged use of steroid injections have its side effects, the risk-benefit ratio should be taken into consideration before administering them.Presence of pain during coughing or deep breathing can be attributed to either fatigue of respiratory muscles due to labored breathing or due to infection.Investigation like X ray of the chest will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis.If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Pulmonologist & get a proper physical examination done.So that appropriate management steps could be taken.Please let me know if you have any further queries.You can ask me a direct query on this website using the below link:  her a good health.Take care.",general,low,[],"['diagnosis', 'disease']",1.0,1.0,1925,True

Some of the symptoms you have mentioned suggest depression and anxiety. Low self-esteem, feeling low, etc., are classical depression symptoms. Hair pulling is one of the anxiety symptoms. Under unconscious anxiety, individuals develop a habit of pulling hair. You have never developed an idea of self-harm, but there is a practice of putting into a risky situation. This could be a feature of bipolar but should be evaluated. History of abuse of weed also increases such risk-taking behavior. If your day-to-day functioning is impaired, then I would advise you to please get yourself evaluated by a psychiatrist. A proper evaluation will help in making a diagnosis.

Antihistamines may cure the symptoms but they are usually not advised as they can cause even more sedation and drowsiness along with red wine/alcohol. Please consult your doctor before using an antihistamine.Personally I would suggest you to take a good nutritional multivitamin-multimineral supplement containing especially vitamin B6, C and other minerals, for 2-3 months, which aid in metabolism of histamine.

medical_10214,Q. Is my 8 months old baby suffering from Hirschsprung's disease or severe constipation?,"Hi doctor, I have gotten two different opinions from two pediatricians about my 8 months old boy. One says my boy has Hirschsprung's disease, and the other says it is just constipation. The first doctor did a rectal exam, yielding no explosive stools, and he wants my son to get a barium enema. The second doctor did not do a rectal exam and just felt my boy's stomach, and said it is not hard and has good bowel sounds. She told me to up his apple juice or water to 8 oz per day with probiotics. KUB was done and shows lots of stool in the large intestine, so the doctor told me to give Miralax and liquid suppository. My son did have suppository a week before the visits with hard poop smear in each diaper ever since. During that time, I had been reporting to my first doctor about my son's constipation. My son started with gentle solids at six months. He is today exactly 8 months old, weighs 21 lbs, and has over 90 % growth in the growth chart. He does not have weight issues. He never had a fever, no blood in stools, has passed his meconium, and had a few projectile vomiting in his lifetime. My son does not fit the HD diagnosis, but my doctor says because of the rectal exam yielding no explosive stool it means it is stuck in the large GI. Is there harm in performing barium enema? My son already had an x-ray, which shows lots of stool in the large intestine. I also just gave him Pedia-Lax, and he had a good bowel movement for the first time since two weeks. I am attaching a picture. I will give him Miralax this weekend with 8 oz liquid a day with probiotics and no solids for now. Is barium enema an old school method? I am so torn because the first doctor in a specialist and has 50 years of experience, and he is adamant that my son has HD even after consulting with his colleagues. Could this just be a bad case of constipation?

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Skinlite contains hydroquinone as well as topical steroid. It will cause fairness initially but it has many side effects such as thinning of skin, white spots, excessive sensitivity towards sunlight. Many of these side effects are permanent. For tanning use a sunscreen like UVRID lotion/ Neutrogena Ultrasheer Sunscreen with 30-50 spf every three hours (e.g. 9:00amd-12:00-3:00pm) with a skin lightening agent like Ban A Tan cream at night time.

It can occur in case of HIV,uncontrolled diabetes,dry mouth, direct contact with infected individuals etc..In case if you have thrush and do not find any other condition as causative for thrush you should get checked for Diabetes..A proper treatment oral intake of antifungal agents like Fluconazole,Itraconazole and topical application of Anti fungal ointments and following of precautionary measures can help in complete resolution of the thrush in a short period of time..Hope this information helps..If you find the answer helpful kindly write a positive review and click on found this answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.",general,low,[],[],1.0,1.0,1711,False

Since Friday the lymph Node is still enlarged but not quite as large as it was Friday. The pediatrician said all his neck lymph nodes were enlarged and one under his jaw bone. He has shotty palpable lymph nodes in the Arm pit and groin areas. Does this sound cancerous?,"Thanks for query.Most lymph node enlargement  in children is due to benign self-limited disease such as viral infections, and adenopathy is secondary to an increase in normal lymphocytes and macrophages in response to an antigen. Other less common mechanisms responsible for adenopathy include nodal accumulation of inflammatory cells in response to an infection in the node (lymphadenitis), neoplastic lymphocytes or macrophages (lymphoma), or metabolite-laden macrophages in storage diseases (Gaucher disease).In young children,front of neck  lymph nodes as large as 2 cm, armpit nodes as large as 1 cm, and groin nodes as large as 1.5 cm in diameter are normal, and further evaluation is usually not indicated.  malignancy is usually associated with nodes larger than 3 cm in diameter.However, the presence of even shotty (< 0.5 cm) supraclavicular or epitrochlear nodes may be associated with malignancy and warrants further evaluation.as your child blood counts are normal I hope its not a serious issue.biopsy of the node will make things more clear.regards",orthopedics,low,[],"['lymphadenitis', 'adenopathy', 'disease']",1.0,1.0,1600,False

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Probably started in the middle of my teenage years. I am 32 now. I have been able to get through pretty good during the years. However, something really nasty started when I was about 27 to 28. Back then it was only sometimes, pretty rare at the start but now it is happening all the time, regardless of who I am interacting with, random people, family, and friends. What I am talking about is something I would describe as terror. So, it is not the everyday fear or anxiety I used to be able to deal with. It is fear as extreme as it gets. I am pretty sure I would not even react in this way if I met a bear in the wood. It happens upon eye contact. There is not really any time in between the eye contact and the arising of this terror, so it is not like I can do anything. My mind reacts with terror as soon as my eyes meet another person's eyes. It comes like a quick surge and then it settles so I can actually still communicate but those surges can still come back later in the conversation. However, these moments of terror are so nasty that I have started to avoid meeting anyone (I know, it does not make things better. But what to do?

For patients with hives, I usually suggest a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement, especially containing vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, etc, which may improve immunity and skin.4. Please avoid extremes of temperatures, too tight-fitting clothes and skin irritants. Loose-fitting & comfortable cotton clothes are better in my opinion for patients with hives. Some patients may also benefit from avoidance of hot/spicy foods or avoidance of packed/canned foods containing preservatives/colors/flavors.5. Please have plenty of liquids during day to maintain hydration and improve metabolism.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.",general,high,"['iching in my body n when I rub my body it appears red pimples on my body n I take it daily', 'an allergy problem from last 8 years']",[],1.0,1.0,1862,False

medical_23544,Q. How long does cold sore virus live in liquid lipstick?,"Hi doctor, I was just wondering how long germs would live on in a liquid lipstick? Around five weeks ago I had a vomiting bug, most likely gastro. I went out on Saturday night and wore a liquid lipstick, and was sick on Sunday. Will these germs still be living in the liquid lipstick and make me sick again or will they have died. Also, if I shared my liquid lipstick with someone who potentially had a cold sore, I am not sure if they get them or not, would those germs live in the liquid lipstick?","Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I understand your concern. There is exactly not much research done on how long bacteria or viruses could survive in a liquid lipstick. If you have had a gastrointestinal infection, and if your lipstick came in contact with your saliva, the microbes could have gone into the lipstick. How long they survive in the lipstick, and how fast they multiply, largely depends on what kind of chemicals were used in the making of the lipstick. Moreover, different microbes need different kinds of growth environment, so it is hard to comment on that. I would advise you to avoid using cosmetics when you are sick. Regarding sharing of your lipstick, it is never a great idea to share your cosmetics with others. Cosmetics should be used as personal items, just like you would use your toothbrush. Sharing cosmetics can lead to the spread of skin infections. If you think you have shared cosmetics with someone you think might have some kind of infection, I would advise you to dispose it, and buy something new.

I have gone through your case and can understand your genuine health concerns. I would like to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine. Proper care and treatment is what you require. According to the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) attached I will need few clarifications that are significant:  1. Slight increase in RBC (red blood cell) count will not cause much problem.  2. Regarding heart chambers, there are no clots seen and no problem with the resting (filling phase) of the heart.  3. There are no issues with the lungs as there is no pulmonary arterial hypertension or clots.  4. Raised ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) value is due to the raised RBC counts.  5. Liver function is normal and no hepatitis B or C.  6. Lipid profile is deranged. Only medications will not help. You need to modify your lifestyle, change your diet and start exercising.  7. Fatty liver may be due to alcohol intake or due to age related deranged lipids.  8. Early changes are observed in the cervical spine.  9. Age related osteoporosis of the bones is seen on chest x-ray and heart seems to be enlarged. 1. Angiography is recommended to see the exact problem with the coronary blood vessels of the heart and also to see if there is a need for CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) or only a stent placement (angioplasty) is enough right now.  2. Let me know if any assistance is required during the course of treatment. 1. Tablet Losartan is a good drug that you are taking. 2. It lowers blood pressure and decreases the risk of stroke in patients with high BP. 1. Avoid having heavy meals containing carbohydrates.  2. Fried fatty foods, junk foods and beverages should be avoided.  3. No added salts.  4. Take plenty of vegetables, salads, fruits and use Canola oil for cooking.  5. Deranged lipid profile is directly related to the heart's blood vessels resulting in bad health.  6. Walk for ten minutes in direct sunlight by applying sunscreen lotion and use sunglasses.

You will conceive soon. Be stress free. You are suffering from secondary infertility. Means you will have first child normally and then you won't conceive.  This may be due to weight gain, increasing age , hormonal imbalance. I would suggets you to get your thyroid profile done and prolactin level checked. Also get your husband semen analysis.  I would sugget you to undergo follicular study . By this you will know you are ovulating or not and also time .

When she was 10 months old, she banged her head between her eyes, inner left brow rather firmly on a blunt object. She was attempting to stand up holding onto a chair, and when she quickly sat, her head firmly bumped the bottom of the portion of the chair which is made of metal. She cried immediately and vomited once but otherwise seemed fine and in a short time was back to play. From all, I read online, and the other family around there was no need to go to emergency.A few weeks later, I started to notice subtle changes. She developed a deep scowl that seemed to favor her left side where she hit. Also, the mark where she hit still came out when she was upset (it still does) and rubbing ensued. I took her into her Pediatrician and told him all three weeks after it happened. I Showed him pictures of the chair where she hit as well as images of her the day after and tried to explain the scowl, the rubbing, and just how I felt something was amiss.He assured me she had none of the symptoms associated with severe head trauma. Six months later and a few visits then all for the same thing I am still unsure and wish we could have look to make sure no tissue or other damage has been done. My question is, if internal damage was done to a vessel or two or a small fracture occurred, is it possible for the symptoms to be slight at this time and if there is a minor ever so slight bleed inside, could it take months if not years for visible signs to occur and irreversible damage to follow suit?

And also if pregnancy occurs fetus can get affected with these hormones.So,better to avoid pregnancy in this month. You can plan the pregnancy in the next month.

medical_6537,Q. How long should my husband and I wait to try for a baby if we did cocaine?,"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Any seasonal variations?b. What are his nose symptoms - running nose, congested nose, sneezing, etc?c. Does he cough more during day or night?d. Does he vomit or nauseate often?e. Does he have gastric disturbances like constipation, frequent stomach pain, frequent diarrhea, etc?f. Did he have any skin problems/allergies since birth?g. Does any of his family member have allergies?Above details would help me to know more about his health and therefore to make suggestions more specifically for him.At present, from your provided details, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. As long as Tb and other chronic lung diseases are concerned, I would think about them only if he is almost always sick, he does not respond to nebulization and other medications, he has serious weight loss, etc. If he does not have above features, I would not think of any serious cause.2. Wheezing is very common in this age and there are many causes like allergies, viral infections (including bronchiolitis), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), childhood asthma (non-allergic), etc. So detailed history is important before suspecting a particular diagnosis and suggesting any investigations.3. I usually prescribe my such patients regular montelukast + levocetirizine which helps for most symptoms. If he develops wheezing, I suggest them nebulization with salbutamol or levosalbutamol on as-and-when-needed basis.4. Cold air, cold drinks and cold foods should be avoided in general, especially if they are aggravating his symptoms.5. Also, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. It is usually true that around 70-80% of the children improve by the age of 6-7 years.Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you.To summarize, if your son does not have any of serious symptoms mentioned in point 1, I would suggest you not to worry.

If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

Due to endurance training as you describe there is a gradual rise in a vagal tone which brings the heart rate in 60 range. However, it's determined by what was your baseline heart rate. Maybe before training your heart rate used to be in 80 s and so now it has dropped to the early 70 s. So that is a substantial drop for you.Importantly Ritalin is a CNS stimulant and can sure push your heart rate high.

I do take some medications for my ADHD and I am aware there are some side effects to that medicine. I could not even remember, a friend's name that I recently met, for some split seconds. Then after some thinking, I could finally remember it. I can remember certain situations that were very important. I could remember something from 5 years ago but not 2 weeks ago. And I do feel like, my memory gets better after I eat food. But it feels like it is getting worse as time passes. I did as a child had to do mind memory games at school, but I felt like I could still remember basic information or situations that happened some days prior. But now, I cannot even remember what I did 3 days ago? Is there something wrong with me? I am showing early signs of dementia? Or I am just overreacting?","Hi. I appreciate that you approached for counseling. I am not sure whether you are diagnosed with ADHD or not. Also please do mention medicines you are taking. Based on given information, it seems that you are experiencing attention problems due to stressful events and preoccupations in your daily work. Also, lack of quality sleep may effect concentration that leads to recalling problems. You need thorough assessment for that. Apparently it is related to anxiousness and stress factors.

The food you have mentioned could very well be the allergen (cause of the allergic reaction). Sea food is a very common allergen, so is oil, which you would have fried your cutlets in.

I am from India too, and as we have the privilege of having many clinics, in almost every nook and corner of our Indian streets, consulting any one of these doctors should help you, as they can help give you immediate relief from your problem.

She should have four to five glasses of warm water daily. It is very good for the heart. Deep breathing - 10 rounds twice daily is very good for her.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.
