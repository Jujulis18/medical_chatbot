If headache persist, better to consult a neurologist and get evaluated. Wishing you good health.

R: Hi...sometimes allergies can take even months together to get better. It doesn't depend only on the medications alone. The most important thing is to take off the triggers. Even if your kid is using medicines regularly, if she is constantly exposed to the allergens which are causing this, then the improvement may not be satisfactory. The allergen can be as simple as a common house dust mite. So I suggest you concentrate on the removal of triggers from her vicinity.Regards - Dr. Sumanth",general,low,[]

In that case, the injections given for the lower jaw numbness would be the major reason for your tongue numbness.

I have been having pain on my left side between my hip bone and my upper femur.I can still run, excercise only certain position hurt. Also hurts when i sleep in certain positions.It s been going on for a couple of months.
R: Hi, In my opinion, this pain in your left side between the hip bone and femur is related to coxarthrosis. This is a very common disease of the hip joint in women and consists of the rheumatic destruction of the joint. The risk of this disease increases with age, obesity, overusing the joint. I suggest you consult a rheumatologist, for a physical examination, and X-ray examination to put the diagnosis.

R: Hello,I have gone through your query and understood your concern. The fact that you have the tendency of acquiring repeated infections in the axilla suggests lowered immunity which should have been evaluated for prior to the pregnancy. Pregnancy itself causes lowered immunity and so, the incidence of abscess formation may rise. The burst abscess may not otherwise harm the fetus except for the fact that the infectious organism causing the abscess may traverse in to the uterine cavity.

R: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.
